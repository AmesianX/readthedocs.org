Ethical Advertising
===================

Read the Docs is a large free website on the internet.
There is one proven business model to support this kind of site:
Advertising.

We talk a bit :ref:`below <ethical-info>` about our philosophy on advertising.

If you're a marketer,
we have :ref:`information <ethical-buy-ads>` on how to get in touch with us about running ads.

Our worldview
-------------

What we're trying to do is to do advertising properly.
We:

* We don't track users
* We don't sell your data
* We host everything ourselves, no third-party scripts

Basically what we're doing is newspaper advertising,
on the internet.
For a hundred years newspapers put an ad on the page,
some folks would see it,
and advertisers would pay for this.
This is our model.

So much ad tech has been built to track users.
You follow them across them web,
from site to site,
showing them the same ad.
Then retailers sell your purchase data to try and attribute sales to advertising.
Now there is an industry in doing fake ad clicks and other scams,
which leads the ad industry to track you even more intrusively to know more about you.
The current advertising industry is a vicious downward cycle.
**We opt out.**

As developers,
we understand the `massive downsides`_ of the current advertising industry.
From malware to your data sold to the highest bidder,
**We opt out.**

We don't store personal information about you.
We keep track of views and clicks.
We don't build a profile of your personality.
We only show high quality ads from companies that are of interest to you.

The trend in advertising is to have larger and larger ads.
They should run before your content,
they should take over the page,
the bigger and flashier the better.
**We opt out.**

We are running a single,
small,
unobtrusive ad on documentation pages.
The products should be interesting to you.
They won't flash or move,
but we will give 10% of our ad inventory to causes we believe in that aren't flashy.
